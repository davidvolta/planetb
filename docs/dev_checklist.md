# Development Checklist


## Upcoming Tasks
- [ ] Change tinting mechanism
- [ ] Fix double clicking bug on spawn units
- [ ] Fix ineligble spawning moves on terrain
- [ ] Now its kind of boring that eggs appear in the same place always
- [ ] Fix Raley Font (lost during architecture update)
- [ ] Style edges of owned biomes (flood fill with stroke)
  - [ ] Refactor for GameController and lessen the load on BoardScene and Gamestore


## Ecosystem Integration Plan

### Phase 5: Create Ecosystem Utilities
- [ ] Create a new utils file `EcosystemUtils.ts` containing:
  - [ ] The polynomial resource generation formula with fixed coefficient values
  - [ ] Egg production logic based on lushness threshold (â‰¥7.0)


- [ ] Create helper functions for common tile-based operations:
  - [ ] Calculate total resource value in a biome
  - [ ] Find blank tiles suitable for egg placement (active=false AND isHabitat=false)
  - [ ] Functions to find all tiles belonging to a specific biome

### Phase 6: Update Rendering System
- [ ] Enhance TileRenderer to:
  - [ ] Use opacity to visualize resource health (value/10)
  - [ ] Keep the existing resource assets, just modify their display
  
### Phase 7: Implement Harvesting System
- [ ] Create new action functions in actions.ts:
  - [ ] selectTile(x, y)
      - Selecting a tile with resources (double click behavior for units/eggs)
  - [ ] harvestTileResource(tileId, amount)
      - Allow partial harvesting (0-10 scale per tile's resource value)
  
- [ ] Add UI components for harvesting:
  - [ ] Harvest button that appears when a tile with resources is selected
  - [ ] Amount slider for selecting harvest amount (0-10 scale)
  - [ ] Implement energy counter (UI and gamestore)

- [ ] Track Resource Harvesting
  - [ ] Track totalHarvested when resources are harvested
  - [ ] Add end-of-turn nonDepletedCount recalculation

- [ ] Implement the harvest logic in gameStore:
  - [ ] Update tile resource values based on the harvested amount
  - [ ] When resourceValue reaches 0, immediately set active=false (permanent conversion)
  - [ ] Update the biome's lushness based on the new tile state

### Phase 9: Replace Habitat Production with Biome-Based Ecosystem
- [ ] Implement resource regeneration based on biome lushness
- [ ] Update biome lushness calculations based on tile resource values
- [ ] Produce dormant animal units (eggs) on blank tiles based on lushness thresholds
- [ ] Keep existing system where eggs are represented as dormant animal units
- [ ] Connect this to the existing evolveAnimal function for converting eggs to active animals

### Phase 10: Refactor Simulator to Use Shared Code
- [ ] Update simulator.js to use the shared EcosystemUtils functions
- [ ] Ensure both the game and simulator use exactly the same calculation methods
