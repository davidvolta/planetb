### Phase 3: Review and Enhance Ecosystem Initialization
- [ ] Audit game initialization flow

  - [ ] Make it adaptable to different board sizes and configurations

- [ ] Update board creation process
  - [ ] Modify board initialization to use the consolidated ecosystem controller
  - [ ] Ensure consistent ecosystem state at game start
  - [ ] Add proper validation for initialized ecosystem

### Phase 4: Simplify Actions API
- [ ] Update produceEggs() action
  - [ ] Simplify to call EcosystemController.updateEcosystem()
  - [ ] Remove any redundant state handling

- [ ] Update evolveAnimal() action
  - [ ] Simplify to call EcosystemController.updateEcosystem()
  - [ ] Pass only necessary parameters

- [ ] Update captureBiome() action
  - [ ] Simplify to call EcosystemController.updateEcosystem()
  - [ ] Ensure all unit state updates are handled properly

- [ ] Review other ecosystem-related actions
  - [ ] Identify any other actions that should use the new approach
  - [ ] Refactor or deprecate as needed

### Phase 5: Integration & Testing
- [ ] Test next turn ecosystem processing
  - [ ] Verify proper egg production on even turns
  - [ ] Confirm all ecosystem dynamics update correctly
  - [ ] Test multiple consecutive turns

- [ ] Test game initialization
  - [ ] Verify resources are generated correctly
  - [ ] Confirm biome lushness is calculated properly
  - [ ] Test different board configurations

- [ ] Test egg production thoroughly
  - [ ] Verify eggs appear in appropriate locations
  - [ ] Confirm lushness increases with egg placement
  - [ ] Test edge cases (no valid tiles, etc.)

- [ ] Test animal evolution thoroughly
  - [ ] Confirm eggs evolve correctly into animals
  - [ ] Verify tile states update properly
  - [ ] Test with multiple concurrent evolutions

- [ ] Add proper unit tests
  - [ ] Test ecosystem calculations
  - [ ] Test state updates
  - [ ] Test error handling

### Phase 6: Documentation & Cleanup
- [ ] Update ecosystem controller documentation
  - [ ] Add clear JSDoc comments to all methods
  - [ ] Document the new architecture pattern
  - [ ] Document the nextTurn and initialization flows

- [ ] Remove deprecated code
  - [ ] Clean up any redundant methods
  - [ ] Remove old console.log statements

- [ ] Update dev notes
  - [ ] Document the new ecosystem update flow
  - [ ] Note any important considerations for future features
  - [ ] Add notes about the "god action" of nextTurn


## Ecosystem Integration Plan

### Phase 5: Create Ecosystem Utilities
- [ ] Create a new utils file `EcosystemUtils.ts` containing:
  - [ ] The polynomial resource generation formula with fixed coefficient values
  - [ ] Egg production logic based on lushness threshold (â‰¥7.0)
  - [ ] Calculate total resource value in a biome
  - [ ] Find blank tiles suitable for egg placement (active=false AND isHabitat=false)
  - [ ] Functions to find all tiles belonging to a specific biome

### Phase 6: Update Rendering System
- [ ] Enhance TileRenderer to:
  - [ ] Use opacity to visualize resource health (value/10)
  - [ ] Keep the existing resource assets, just modify their display
  
### Phase 7: Implement Harvesting System
- [ ] Create new action functions in actions.ts:
  - [ ] selectTile(x, y)
      - Selecting a tile with resources (double click behavior for units/eggs)
  - [ ] harvestTileResource(tileId, amount)
      - Allow partial harvesting (0-10 scale per tile's resource value)
  
- [ ] Add UI components for harvesting:
  - [ ] Harvest button that appears when a tile with resources is selected
  - [ ] Amount slider for selecting harvest amount (0-10 scale)
  - [ ] Implement energy counter (UI and gamestore)

- [ ] Track Resource Harvesting
  - [ ] Track totalHarvested when resources are harvested
  - [ ] Add end-of-turn nonDepletedCount recalculation

- [ ] Implement the harvest logic in gameStore:
  - [ ] Update tile resource values based on the harvested amount
  - [ ] When resourceValue reaches 0, immediately set active=false (permanent conversion)
  - [ ] Update the biome's lushness based on the new tile state

### Phase 9: Replace Habitat Production with Biome-Based Ecosystem
- [ ] Implement resource regeneration based on biome lushness
- [ ] Update biome lushness calculations based on tile resource values
- [ ] Produce dormant animal units (eggs) on blank tiles based on lushness thresholds
- [ ] Keep existing system where eggs are represented as dormant animal units
- [ ] Connect this to the existing evolveAnimal function for converting eggs to active animals

### Phase 10: Refactor Simulator to Use Shared Code
- [ ] Update simulator.js to use the shared EcosystemUtils functions
- [ ] Ensure both the game and simulator use exactly the same calculation methods
