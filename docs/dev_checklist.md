# Development Checklist

## Project Context
- Project Name: Planet B
- Description: A unique turn-based 4x ecological strategy game that dispenses with traditional mechanics and power structures. Planet B models nature and population dynamics to create gameplay that asks the user to balance their growth and exploitation with the world's natural rates of production. 

## Environment Setup
- Node.js environment
- React + Vite
- TypeScript
- Zustand + immer for game state management
- Phaser as our game engine

## Current Focus:
- Focus on core game mechanics (movement, reproduction, interactions, state updates, etc.) client-side in a way that could later run on a server. 

## Upcoming Tasks
- [] Implement habitats
- [] Add unit production (eggs)
- [] Add unit spawning

- [] Implement habitat improvement

- [] Add fog of war

- [] Unit movement
  - [] Add highlight for available moves
  - [] Add unit selector
  - [] Add Secondary (tile) selector
    
- [] Performance optimizations
  - [] Add viewport culling to only render visible tiles
  - [] Tile Object Pooling
  - [] Implement texture-based rendering for terrain tiles
  - [] Create incremental updates to avoid full board recreation
  - [] Optimize event listeners with event delegation
