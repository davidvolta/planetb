2. Balance testing and tuning
   - Test recovery rates at different lushness values
   - Ensure strategic trade-offs for different playstyles
   - Validate ecological balance mechanics
   - Fine-tune the resilience curve and impact reduction values


- [ ] Style edges of owned biomes (flood fill with stroke)

- [ ] Implement harvesting
