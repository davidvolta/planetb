## Performance Optimizations (Biggest Bang for Buck)

1. **Replace Graphics with Textures/Sprites** (ðŸ•“)
   - Your current approach recreates Graphics objects for every tile on every board update
   - Instead: Generate textures once during preload and reuse them for all tiles
   - Expected gain: 50-70% FPS improvement as Graphics rendering is extremely CPU intensive

2. **Implement Viewport Culling** (ðŸ•“)
   - You're currently rendering all tiles even if they're off-screen
   - Only render tiles that are visible in the current viewport
   - Expected gain: 30-40% improvement for large maps when zoomed in

3. **Optimize Event Listeners** (Medium Impact)
   - Your current implementation adds event listeners to every tile
   - Use event delegation (one listener on the container instead of one per tile)
   - Expected gain: 10-15% improvement, especially on larger boards

4. **Incremental Board Updates** (Medium Impact)
   - You're recreating the entire board when state changes
   - Only update tiles that actually changed
   - Expected gain: 20-30% improvement when making small state changes

5. **Object Pooling for Tiles** (Medium Impact)
   - Reuse tile objects instead of destroying and recreating them
   - Expected gain: 10-20% improvement during board updates
