## Performance Optimizations (Biggest Bang for Buck)

1. **Replace Graphics with Textures/Sprites** (üïì)
   - Your current approach recreates Graphics objects for every tile on every board update
   - Instead: Generate textures once during preload and reuse them for all tiles
   - Expected gain: 50-70% FPS improvement as Graphics rendering is extremely CPU intensive

2. **Implement Viewport Culling** (üïì)
   - You're currently rendering all tiles even if they're off-screen
   - Only render tiles that are visible in the current viewport
   - Expected gain: 30-40% improvement for large maps when zoomed in

3. **Optimize Event Listeners** (Medium Impact)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial Optimization: Each tile still has setInteractive() called on it individually, which is necessary for Phaser to detect which specific tile was clicked, but isn't the most optimal approach from a pure performance perspective.For 100% optimization, you'd need to replace the individual setInteractive() calls with a custom hit detection system, but that would be more complex and might not be worth the effort given the current performance.

4. **Incremental Board Updates** (Medium Impact)
   - You're recreating the entire board when state changes
   - Only update tiles that actually changed
   - Expected gain: 20-30% improvement when making small state changes

5. **Object Pooling for Tiles** (Medium Impact)
   - Reuse tile objects instead of destroying and recreating them
   - Expected gain: 10-20% improvement during board updates
