BIOME CENTRIC DESIGN

### 1. Ownership Model
Currently, players own habitats, but biomes are tied to habitats through the `habitatId` property. This creates an indirect ownership chain:
- Player owns habitat
- Habitat has biome
- Biome contains territory

This could be simplified by having players directly own biomes, making habitat merely a feature within a biome.

### 2. Egg Production Logic
The current `getValidEggPlacementTiles` function is complex partly because:
- It starts with a habitat
- Needs to find its biome
- Then scans for tiles in that biome
- Checks resource adjacency

If biomes were the primary entity, this would be more direct:
- Start with biome
- Check biome's lushness
- Place eggs directly in suitable biome tiles

### 3. Resource-Habitat-Biome Relationship
Resources are currently placed avoiding habitats, then assigned biome IDs. The `generateResources` function:
- Groups tiles by biome ID
- Checks if habitats exist at positions
- Creates a complex map of biome-to-tiles

A biome-first approach would simplify this to:
- Each biome has its territory
- Resources are generated within biomes based on biome type
- No need for the complex habitat-avoidance logic

### 4. Egg Production and Turn Processing
The `biomeEggProduction` function currently:
- Iterates through habitats
- Checks if habitat has production and ownership
- Finds valid tiles within the habitat's biome
- Creates eggs based on habitat production rate

This could be streamlined to:
- Iterate through biomes
- Check biome health/lushness
- Create eggs based on biome properties directly

### 5. Player Territory Recognition
The code repeatedly has to build sets of biomes owned by players:
```typescript
const playerBiomeIds = new Set<string>();
playerBiomeIds.add(habitatBiomeId);
// Find all biomes owned by this player by checking habitats
habitats.forEach(h => {
  if (h.ownerId === habitatOwnerId && h.ownerId !== null) {
    // get biome...
  }
});
```

With biome-centric design, this becomes simply:
```typescript
// Get all biomes owned by player
const playerBiomes = biomes.filter(b => b.ownerId === playerId);
```

### 6. Habitat-Biome Data Duplication
Currently there's duplicated information across habitats and biomes:
- Habitat has position, state, owner ID
- Biome has ID, habitat ID, lushness

This could be simplified to biomes containing habitats as features, not the reverse.

### 7. Resource Adjacency Calculations
The code that prioritizes tiles for egg placement based on resource adjacency would be simplified if the biome was the primary organizational unit, since resources already have biome IDs.

By shifting to a biome-centric approach, you could reduce many of the complex lookups and cross-referencing between systems, creating a more straightforward flow where biomes are the core ecological unit of your game.
