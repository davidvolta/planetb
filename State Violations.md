## Game.tsx Subscription Issues

1. **Partial Subscription Implementation**
   ```typescript
   const boardState = useGameStore(state => state.board);
   ```
   - Game.tsx properly subscribes to board state changes
   - However, it doesn't create a proper communication channel between Zustand and Phaser
   - There's no proper state observation system for fine-grained updates
   
2. **Inefficient Update Mechanism**
   - When boardState changes, Game.tsx triggers a full scene update:
   ```typescript
   useEffect(() => {
     if (gameRef.current && boardState) {
       const scene = gameRef.current.scene.getScene('BoardScene') as BoardScene;
       if (scene && scene.scene.isActive()) {
         if (typeof (scene as any).updateBoard === 'function') {
           (scene as any).updateBoard();
         } else {
           scene.scene.restart();
         }
       }
     }
   }, [boardState]);
   ```
   - This forces complete recreation of all tiles instead of updating only changed tiles
   - A more granular update system would improve performance
