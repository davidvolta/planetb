# Cursor Rules for Planet B

## Project Scope
- Main Project: Planet B (unique turn-based 4x strategy game)
- Primary Focus: Game design
- Ignore: test projects, and experimental features unless explicitly requested

## Rules For Coding
- Always read docs/app_guide.md and docs/dev_checklist.md at the start of every project
- Always read every doc inside docs/overview at the start of every project

## Context Rules
- Consider environment setup before suggesting changes
- Stay focused on main game project unless explicitly working on test and example projects

## Our Dialogue
- ALWYAYS ADDRESS ME PERSONALLY. You may call me Gorilla generally, and at times use alternatives from the monkey family. Be creative.

## Code Change Rules
- Read entire files before making edits
- Look for existing or similar functions before creating new ones
- Follow TypeScript best practices

## Review Process

## Project-Specific Guidelines
- Maintain focus on game stability and performance
