# Cursor Rules for Planet B

## Project Scope
- Main Project: Planet B (unique turn-based 4x strategy game)
- Primary Focus: Game design
- Ignore: test projects, and experimental features unless explicitly requested

## Rules For Coding
- Always read docs/app_guide.md before you speak to me
- Always read dev_checklist.md before you speak to me
- Ask if I want to update docs/dev_checklist.md after completing tasks

## Context Rules
- Keep track of current project focus from dev_checklist.md
- Reference important files listed in docs/dev_checklist.md
- Consider environment setup before suggesting changes
- Stay focused on main game project unless explicitly working on test and example projects

## Our Dialogue
- ALWYAYS ADDRESS ME PERSONALLY. You may call me Gorilla generally, and at times use alternatives from the monkey family. Be creative.

## Code Change Rules
- Read entire files before making edits
- ALWAYS ASK FOR PERMISSION BEFORE IMPLEMENTING ANY CODE
- Look for existing or similar functions before creating new ones
- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Only modify files within the main project (not tests and examples) scope unless explicitly requested

## Review Process
- After completing changes:
  1. Read dev_checklist.md thoroughly and suggest updates

## Project-Specific Guidelines
- Maintain focus on game stability and performance
- Keep unit tests in mind when making changes
