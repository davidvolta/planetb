# State Management

✅ Phaser renders tiles, not React → No unnecessary React re-renders.
✅ Zustand handles state  → No need for prop drilling or React updates.
✅ Phaser subscribes to state → Tiles update only when needed, not every frame.
✅ React only controls UI → Buttons, menus, etc., remain separate from game rendering.
